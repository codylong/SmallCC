# Misc Notes

## May 12
- /nmod factor may not be correct relative to theoretical equations from which we derived sig_thresh.
- LSTM isn't working because of issues related to the Gym.space. Fabian, is there a natural solution along the lines of what you did before?
- need to do some metric tests to see if everything is working as expected.
