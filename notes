- how big should Lambda_0 be? someone must have tried to estimate this
- code vol and dvol
- determine how det(g) depends on K based on how we choose g
- Denef-Douglas relates classic problems to BP. Any lit on good MDP's that solve
  these problems that can be mapped onto BP?
- since BP and the Arkani-Hamed et al model are both NP complete, it means that
  (assuming P != NP) we will not be able to solve it in polynomial time
- look up literature on optimal solutions to NP-complete problems with
       deep reinforcement learning.

IDEA 1:
- in some sense the question is how to have an algorithm that lowers the base
     of the exponential as much as possible.
- if O(b^N), then log_10(b^N) ~ some log identity. this should allow me to read
     off b in some way based on the slope of a best fit line. one would love to
     have an RL agent that finds a way to minimize b, where each value of b
     requires its own RL agent.

IDEA 2:
- we should DEMONSTRATE the exponential growth that is expected for this
  NP-complete problem.
- we should compare this to the expoential growth associated with the random
  walk.

New reward structure? This is effectively a maze: we are taking steps and we
  want to get somewhere, and get there as quickly as possible.
  - second thought: this doesn't work, because the goal is to find A solution,
    not find a solution as quickly as possible. the second we have a useful update
    due to end of game by getting out of the maze, we've actually already solved
    our real problem.x
